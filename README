This readme will be expanded later, once comments/documentation is more finalized. Just setting up the repository for now.

The Fastboi engine itself only consists of a few parts:
* FastboiCore
* Gameobject (+Component)
* Transform
* Renderer
* Collider
* Phyiscs (+VelocityComponent)
* Camera
* Input
* Resources
* Events

However, many premade components are provided for ease of use and development. Provided components:
* SpriteRenderer
* RepeatRenderer
* RectUI
* ColorComp
* BoxColorRenderer
* ChangeObserver

Also in the repository (For now), is a test game called "Slowboi." This is merely to demonstrate some of the basic capabilities.
It is rather rudimentary and has no actual gameplay, but that will be added to over time.
